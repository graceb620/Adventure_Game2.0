# Adventure_Game2.0
This is the second version of the avdventure game that I created. 

## If you have issues
One common issue I have had while trying to run this program is the bin folder clearing the needed files. This is the first area I would check if you have issues. 
* If you find that after attempting to run the program that the bin folder doesn't have a long list of files that begin with 'api' follow the steps below.

### Fixing the bin issue
1. First click the link below, or put the link in your search bar. This will download the needed JavaFX files.

3. Delete everything in the original bin folder and replace them with the files in the newly downloaded one. I personally use ctrl+a then delete then copy and paste the new files into the bin folder.
4. After this is done it should be working properly.
